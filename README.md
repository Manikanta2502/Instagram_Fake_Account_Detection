# Instagram_Fake_Account_Detection

The project uses machine learning algorithm to find out the fake accounts available .
We used Logistic Regression model to train the model with a small dataset . 
The accuracy of the project is 93% and 91% after 5 folds . 
The model works using the data available about Instagram User on instagram, It uses data such as followers, following , availability of profile pic , posts and some more details as such .


Steps to Run the code Locally:
We recommand using Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook for the process.
1) Download all the files available here and unzip them.
2) Open the main ipynb file .
3) Upload the instagram.csv file to the program.
4) Run the code
5) The code automatically downloads all the required libraries and modules needed.
6) It automatically gives you the model(saved) file as well.
7) You can use the model file whenever needed instead of running all the program
8) Input the details the program asks for such as profile pic status and so.
9) The program gives you the output as "Fake" or "Not Fake"
